This page contains introductory-level material for several programming languages. These languages were selected for their wide-spread popularity among the life sciences. Basic skills using one or more of these languages can be immensely helpful in processing data, statistical analysis, creating publication-quality visuals, and many others.  Although these are in the Introductory section, some prior knowledge of [Linux](../IntroToLinux) would be a plus.

* [Perl](Perl)
* [R](R)
