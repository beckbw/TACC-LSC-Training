# TACC Life Sciences Computing Training

### Welcome!

This github page is a repository of training materials for the TACC Life
Sciences Computing group. We are currently exploring different methods for
organizing and presenting these materials. Our main objectives in using github
are:

* Organize the course materials into an easily navigatable interface. 
* Present concise overviews of the course content.
* Provide a centralized repository of course files (or links to large files) for download.
* Store a chronicle of past course offerings (including date, institution, and course files).

To aid in quality control and instructional alignment, Contributors will ensure course overviews include:

* *Course Objectives*:  General purpose of the course. 
* *Instructional Objectives*: The general format of the course and assessment mechanisms.
* *Specific Learning Objectives*: Detailed topic deliverables that students will be able to perform.

### Courses

Courses are organized hierarchically in folders by user experience, scope, topic, and training location / date.
* `Introductory` courses are those in which limited prior knowledge or experience is needed to easily undertake the training as well as topics with a broad scope or impact.
* `Advanced` courses generally assume a student will be aware of the content of the `Introductory` courses and will generic have a more targetted or specific scope.
* `Workshops` are specific training sessions of `Introductory` or `Advanced` courses organized by the host institution and date they were presented.

Note: While workshops will contain substantially the same information as in `Introductory` or `Advanced` they will likely present institution specific content as well.
