# Batch Job Submission

### Course Objectives

The workshop is designed to introduce skills required to perform computational research in the life sciences. It will cover topics in high performance computing including environment variables, modules, and batch job submission. This workshop is intended for people who have some experience with a command line interface, and intend to use a Linux workstation or HPC cluster for life science research.

This course is divided into two modules:

 1. [Environment and Modules](#mod1)
 2. [Batch Job Submission](#mod2)


### Instructional Objectives

This course should be taught in a room equipped with computers and internet access. Rooms not equipped with computers will work if the students bring their own laptops and have internet access. Students should also have an existing allocation on a TACC or Host Institution resource. Students without an allocation can still participate in most components of the workshop if they have a Mac / Linux laptop, or a Windows laptop with Putty installed and access to a Linux server.
