# TACC Life Sciences Computing Training

### Welcome!

This github page is a repository of training materials for the TACC Life
Sciences Computing group. We are currently exploring different methods for
organizing and presenting these materials. Our main objectives in using github
are:

1. Organize the course materials into an easily navigatable interface. 
2. Present concise overviews of the course content.
3. Provide a centralized repository of course files (*links* to large files) for download.
4. Store a chronicle of past course offerings (including date, institution, and course files).

To aid in quality control and instructional alignment, Contributors will ensure course overviews include:

1. *Course Objectives*:  General purpose of the course. 
2. *Instructional Objectives*: The general format of the course and assessment mechanisms.
3. *Specific Learning Objectives*: Detailed topic deliverables that students will be able to perform.

### Courses

We intend to host many different courses on this site.
Currently, courses are organized hierarchically by folders by user experience and topic.
For example:

Experience | Topic | Path
-----------|-------|-------
[Introductory](/Introductory) | [Intro to HPC for Life Sciences](/Introductory/HPC/IntroToHPCforLSC)| `/TACC-LSC-Training/Introductory/HPC/IntroToHPCforLSC`
[Advanced](/Advanced) | Xeon PHI programming and optimization | `/TACC-LSC-Training/Advanced/HPC/AdvXeonPHI`

For now click on [Introductory](/Introductory) or [Advanced](/Advanced) to start browsing.
There is a lot more to come, but for now, perhaps look at the following courses:

Course Name |
----------- |
[Intro to HPC for Life Sciences](/Introductory/HPC/IntroToHPCforLSC) |
[Best Practices in Data Management](/Introductory/HPC/DataManagement) |
