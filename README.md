# TACC Life Sciences Computing Training Homepage

Welcome!

This github page is a repository of training materials for the TACC Life
Sciences Computing group. We are currently exploring different methods for
organizing and presenting these materials. Our main objectives in using github
are:

  1) To present the materials in a way that are easy for a user to navigate.

  2) To maintain an easily accessible repository of class files for download.

  3) To store historical version of class files delivered at different times and
at different institutions.

There is a lot more to come, but for now, perhaps look at the following courses:

Course Name
----------
[Intro to HPC for Life Sciences](/Intro/HPC/IntroToHPCforLSC)
[Best Practices in Data Management](/Intro/HPC/DataManagement)

And feel free to clone this entire repository via the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/wjallen/TACC-LSC-Training
```
