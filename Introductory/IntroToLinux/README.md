# Introduction to Linux

### Course Objectives

This course is designed to introduce skills required to perform computational research in the life sciences. Students will learn and practice commands in a Linux terminal, the text editor VIM, and basic shell scripting. This material is intended for people who have little to no experience with a command line interface, but intend to use a Linux workstation or HPC cluster for life science research.

This course is divided into three modules:

 1. [Linux Command Line Basics](#mod1)
 2. [Text Editing with VIM](#mod2)
 3. [Simple Shell Scripting](#mod3)

### Instructional Objectives

This course is taught as an interactive workshop. Students will actively engage in course discussion, and participate with working examples in a Linux terminal. As such, it is necessary that students have access to a command line interface for the course. It should be taught in a room equipped with computers and internet access. Rooms not equipped with computers will work if the students bring their own laptops and have internet access. Students should also have an existing allocation on a TACC or Host Institution resource. Students without an allocation can still participate in most components of the workshop if they have a Mac / Linux laptop, or a Windows laptop with Putty installed and access to a Linux server.

| Module 2: Text Editing with VIM |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| &#8226;	Switching back and forth between insert mode (IM) vs. normal mode (NM) (`i, o, O, Esc`). |
| &#8226;	IM: Entering text as a typical text editor. |
| &#8226;	NM: Navigating a file (`<arrow keys>, hjkl, 0, $, gg, G, Ctrl+u. Ctrl+d`). |
| &#8226;	NM: Deleting, coping, and pasting text (`x, dw, dd, yy, p, P, <number><command>`). |
| &#8226;	NM: Searching for text (`/pattern, n, N`). |
| &#8226;	NM: The command line (`:, :<line number>, :%s/find/replace/gc, :read <file>`). |
| &#8226;	NM: Saving and quitting (`:w, :wq, :q, :q!`). |
| &#8226;	NM: Other useful things to know (`u, Ctrl+r, .`) |
|  |
| **Students should be able to…** |
|	&#9702; Open, edit, and save documents with VIM. |
|	&#9702; Switch back and forth between insert mode and normal mode. |
|	&#9702; Navigate to different parts of a file quickly. |
|	&#9702; Search for a specific string of text. |
|	&#9702; Find and replace text. |

| Module 3: Simple (`bash`) Shell Scripting |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| &#8226;	The body of a simple shell script – header, comments, commands, exit. |
| &#8226;	Assigning variables, manipulating variables. |
| &#8226;	Conditionals with `if` / `elif` / `else`. |
| &#8226;	Loop control with `while` and `for`. |
|  |
| **Students should be able to…** |
| &#9702; Create a simple shell script with a header, comments, and commands. |
|	&#9702; Change permissions and execute a shell script on the command line. |
