# Advanced Courses

### Overview

This folder contains advanced materials from the TACC Life Sciences Computing group curriculum. For the purposes of organization, we have defined *advanced material* as that which likely requires some prior knowledge to complete, and is narrow in scope. Much of the prior knowledge that may be required can be found in the [Introductory](../Introductory) materials. A detailed list of all topics currently supported by the group is provided below:

* [Parallel Programming](ParallelProg) : Programming parallel code, including profiling, for the life sciences
* [Virtual Machines](VirtualMachines) : An overview of setting up and running applications on virtual machines
* [Xeon Phi](XeonPhi) : Offloading to and programming for the Intel Xeon Phi

### Applications

Advanced materials for various popular software packages used in the life sciences can be found by following the link to [Applications](Applications). The current course offerings include:

* [Gromacs](Applications/Gromacs) : Open source MD simulation
* [DOCK6](Applications/DOCK6) : Structure-based molecular docking
* [Samtools](Applications/Samtools) : Utilities for sorting, merging, indexing, and generating sequence alignments

### Previous Materials

A record of previous courses and the accompanying materials can be found under [Workshops](../Workshops).
