This page contains introductory-level material for several programming languages. These languages were selected for their wide-spread popularity among the life sciences. Basic skills using one or more of these languages can be immensely helpful in many ways including processing data and creating publication-quality visuals.  Although these are in the Introductory section, some prior knowledge of [Linux](../IntroToLinux) and the command line interface would be a plus.
