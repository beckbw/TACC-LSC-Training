# Tools

This page contains introductory-level material for several programming languages. These languages were selected for their wide-spread popularity among the life sciences. Basic skills using one or more of these languages can be immensely helpful in processing data, statistical analysis, creating publication-quality visuals, and many others.  Although these are in the Introductory section, some prior knowledge of [Linux](../IntroToLinux) and the command line interface would be a plus.

Current course offerings:

* [Python](Tools/Python) : Very powerful when integrated with Matplotlib, Numpy, and Scipy
* [Perl](Tools/Perl) : A very fast and intutitive scripting language for quick and dirty jobs
* [R](Tools/R) : Open source statistical analysis software
* [Matlab](Tools/Matlab) : High-level, cross-discipline programming language
