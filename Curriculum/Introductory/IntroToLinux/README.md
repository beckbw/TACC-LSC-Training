# Introduction to Linux

### Course Objectives

This course is designed to introduce skills required to perform computational research in the life sciences. Students will learn and practice commands in a Linux terminal, the text editor VIM, and basic shell scripting. This material is intended for people who have little to no experience with a command line interface, but intend to use a Linux workstation or HPC cluster for life science research.

This course is divided into three modules:

 1. [Linux Command Line Basics](#mod1)
 2. [Text Editing with VIM](#mod2)
 3. [Simple Shell Scripting](#mod3)

### Instructional Objectives

This course is taught as an interactive workshop. Students will actively engage in course discussion, and participate with working examples in a Linux terminal. As such, it is necessary that students have access to a command line interface for the course. It should be taught in a room equipped with computers and internet access. Rooms not equipped with computers will work if the students bring their own laptops and have internet access. Students should also have an existing allocation on a TACC or Host Institution resource. Students without an allocation can still participate in most components of the workshop if they have a Mac / Linux laptop, or a Windows laptop with Putty installed and access to a Linux server.
