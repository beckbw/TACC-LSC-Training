# Tools

This page contains introductory-level material for several programming languages. These languages were selected for their wide-spread popularity among the life sciences. Basic skills using one or more of these languages can be immensely helpful in processing data, statistical analysis, creating publication-quality visuals, and many others.  Although these are in the Introductory section, some prior knowledge of [Linux](../IntroToLinux) and the command line interface would be a plus.

Current course offerings:

* [Python](Tools/Python)
* [Perl](Tools/Perl)
* [R](Tools/R)
* [Matlab](Tools/Matlab)
