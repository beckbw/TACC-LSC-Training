## Instructions to Course Content developers

### Content location
In general Course Content developers should create broad scope, general interest, or basic knowledge courses in the `Introductory` section. Specific topics or ones of narrow scope such as a single software applications should be placed into `Advanced`. Content Developers should keep new topics or folders in a local repository fork until general review by all developers.<br/>
The exception to this is `Workshops`. Here developers are requested to create/merge institution and date specfic folders of delivered workshops constructed from the source materials provided in `Introductory` or `Advanced`. In this way, a historical chronicle is maintained for both Instructors and Students to reference.

### Objectives

For each course created in any of `Introductory`, `Advanced`, or `Workshops`, developers are **REQUIRED** to include information about `Course`, `Instructional`, and `Specfic Learning Objectives`.
* *Course Objectives*:  General purpose of the course. 
* *Instructional Objectives*: The general format of the course and assessment mechanisms.
* *Specific Learning Objectives*: Detailed topic deliverables that students will be able to perform.

These COs, IOs, and SLOs aid in quality control and instructional alignment.
A template [`README.template.md`](/README.template.md) file is provided to insert into the overview of any developed course.

### Accessory data/files

Accessory files, such as sample data, archives, and presentation slides (PPT, PDF) may be included in the related course folder if the file is less than 10MB. For accessory files greater than 10MB, a link to an external storage site should be included instead. For example, a publically shared file residing at https://utexas.app.box.com might be shared as:

>Download the sequence file for the protein actin from [1atn.fasta](https://utexas.box.com/shared/static/3v1bh67km84vyvyldurhh2p64r07g3p6.fasta).
