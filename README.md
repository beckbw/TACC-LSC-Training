# TACC Life Sciences Computing Training

### Welcome!

This github page is a repository of training materials for the TACC Life
Sciences Computing group. We are currently exploring different methods for
organizing and presenting these materials. Our main objectives in using github
are:

1. Organize the course materials into an easily navigatable interface. 
2. Present concise overviews of the course content.
2. Provide a centralized repository of course files for download.
3. Store a chronicle of past course offerings (including date and institution),
as well as historical snapshots of course files.


### Courses

We intend to host 10 or more different courses on this site. Click on
[Intro](/Intro) or [Adv](/Adv) to start browsing. There is a lot more to come,
but for now, perhaps look at the following courses:

Course Name |
----------- |
[Intro to HPC for Life Sciences](/Intro/HPC/IntroToHPCforLSC) |
[Best Practices in Data Management](/Intro/HPC/DataManagement) |
